# 🌐 3D Features Added - Dynamic Revolving Models

## ✨ What's Been Added

I've added **5 new 3D component systems** that create dynamic, scroll-based 3D animations throughout your website!

---

## 🎨 New 3D Components

### 1. **Floating3DObject** (Base Component)
The foundation for all 3D shapes with 5 different models:

- ✅ **Cube** - Classic wireframe cube with distortion
- ✅ **Torus** - Donut shape with metallic sheen
- ✅ **Cone** - Pointed cone with smooth distortion
- ✅ **Octahedron** - 8-sided diamond shape
- ✅ **Tetrahedron** - Pyramid shape

**Features:**
- Automatic rotation and floating animation
- Distortion effects with shaders
- Metallic and rough materials
- Customizable colors

---

### 2. **ScrollReveal3D** (Wipe Transition Wrapper)
3D objects that wrap text sections with scroll-based wipe animations

**How it works:**
- Slides in from left/right/center based on scroll
- Wipe effect reveals the 3D object progressively
- Object moves across screen as you scroll
- Fades out smoothly at the end

**Where it's used:**
- ✅ First text section: **White Cube** sliding from LEFT
- ✅ Second text section: **Blue Torus** sliding from RIGHT  
- ✅ Final text section: **Black Octahedron** from CENTER

**Animations:**
- Entry: Wipes in from edge (0% → 100% visible)
- During scroll: Moves across screen with rotation
- Exit: Wipes out to opposite edge
- Smooth spring physics

---

### 3. **Floating3DDecorator** (Background Decorators)
Multiple small 3D objects floating in the background

**Features:**
- Multiple shapes animate simultaneously
- Each moves independently across screen
- Left-to-right and right-to-left patterns
- Staggered timing for organic feel
- Wipe transitions for each object

**Where it's used:**
- ✅ **About Section**: Octahedron (left) + Tetrahedron (right)
- ✅ **Services Section**: Cone (right) + Cube (left)

**Pattern:**
- Objects start off-screen
- Wipe in as you scroll down
- Float across the viewport
- Wipe out as you scroll past
- Different speeds create depth

---

### 4. **Revolving3DOrbit** (Circular Orbit Animation)
A 3D object that orbits around the screen center

**How it works:**
- Circular/elliptical orbit path
- 2 full rotations during scroll
- Circular wipe effect (grows from center)
- Changes size during orbit

**Where it's used:**
- ✅ **Approach Section**: White Torus orbiting around content

**Animation stages:**
1. Starts as small dot (0% visible)
2. Wipes outward in circle
3. Orbits around screen center
4. Shrinks back to dot
5. Wipes away

---

### 5. **Enhanced3DSection** (Multi-Object Scene)
Full section with 3 colorful 3D objects moving together

**Features:**
- 3 different shapes with different colors
- Each has unique movement pattern
- Synchronized yet independent
- Colorful (blue, pink, green)

**Objects:**
- 🔷 **Blue Cube**: Diagonal movement, 720° rotation
- 🔶 **Pink Torus**: Opposite diagonal, counter-rotation
- 🟢 **Green Cone**: Vertical wave pattern

**Where it's used:**
- ✅ New section between Brands and Approach
- ✅ Content: "Crafted with precision"

## 🎬 Animation Breakdown

### Entry Animations (Scroll Down)
1. **Wipe In**: Object appears progressively from edge
2. **Fade In**: Opacity 0 → 1
3. **Scale Up**: Grows from 50% → 100%
4. **Slide In**: Moves into position from off-screen

### During Scroll
1. **Translate**: Moves across viewport (X and Y)
2. **Rotate**: Continuous rotation (360°+)
3. **Float**: Subtle up/down bobbing
4. **Scale**: Slight size changes for depth

### Exit Animations (Scroll Up/Down)
1. **Wipe Out**: Object disappears progressively
2. **Fade Out**: Opacity 1 → 0
3. **Scale Down**: Shrinks to 50%
4. **Slide Out**: Moves off-screen

## 📐 Wipe Transition Types

### 1. **Horizontal Wipe** (Left/Right)
```
Left to Right: inset(0 100% 0 0) → inset(0 0% 0 0)
Right to Left: inset(0 0 0 100%) → inset(0 0% 0 0%)
```

### 2. **Vertical Wipe** (Top/Bottom)
```
Top to Bottom: inset(100% 0 0 0) → inset(0% 0 0 0)
Bottom to Top: inset(0 0 100% 0) → inset(0% 0 0 0%)
```

### 3. **Circular Wipe** (Center Out)
```
Expand: circle(0% at 50% 50%) → circle(100% at 50% 50%)
Contract: circle(100% at 50% 50%) → circle(0% at 50% 50%)
```

## ⚡ Performance Optimizations

✅ **Lazy Loading**: All 3D components load only when needed
✅ **Suspense**: Loading states prevent layout shift
✅ **Spring Physics**: Smooth, natural animations
✅ **GPU Acceleration**: Hardware-accelerated transforms
✅ **Conditional Rendering**: Objects only render when in viewport
✅ **Optimized Geometry**: Low polygon counts

---

## 🎯 Scroll Behavior

### Scroll Down (Normal)
1. Object wipes in from edge
2. Moves across screen
3. Rotates continuously
4. Wipes out to opposite edge

### Scroll Up (Reverse)
1. Animations play in reverse
2. Objects move backwards
3. Wipe directions reverse
4. Smooth transitions

### Scroll Speed
- Fast scroll: Quick transitions
- Slow scroll: Smooth, detailed movements
- Spring physics adapt to speed

## 🎨 Color Scheme

Maintaining the black/white aesthetic with subtle accents:

- **White** (#ffffff) - Primary 3D objects
- **Blue** (#4a9eff) - Accent objects
- **Grayscale** (#666, #777, #888, #999) - Background decorators
- **Black** (#000000) - Dark mode objects
- **Colorful** (RGB) - Enhanced section only

<ScrollReveal3D 
  type="torus"  // cube, torus, cone, octahedron, tetrahedron
  color="#ff0000" 
  position="left"
/>
```

### Change Movement Direction
```typescript
position="left"   // Slides left to right
position="right"  // Slides right to left  
position="center" // Rotates in place

size={350}  // Size in pixels (recommended: 150-400)
```

### Change Colors
```typescript
color="#4a9eff"  // Any hex color
```

### Adjust Orbit Radius
```typescript
<Revolving3DOrbit 
  orbitRadius={400}  // Larger = wider orbit
/>
```

### Add More Decorators
```typescript
<Floating3DDecorator 
  shapes={[
    { type: 'cube', color: '#fff', size: 200, initialPosition: 'left' },
    { type: 'torus', color: '#0ff', size: 180, initialPosition: 'right' },
    // Add more shapes here
  ]}
/>
```
